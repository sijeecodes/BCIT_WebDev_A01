AI interactions

1. Used AI
 - ChatGPT (free access)
 - Grok (free access)

2. Usage
 - For prototyping through image.
 - Ask questions of HTML and CSS, when my codes don't give intended output.

3. Thoughts
 - AI's didn't do much of the coding in my assignment,
   but it did give me some ideas about how the html and css should be made.
   It saved me time on finding answers to my questions, since it's faster than searching the web.
   Also, comparing two AIs was interesting.
